    <h1>Theodor Herzl's meeting with the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire to buy Palestine :</h1>
    <img src="images/image.pj.png" alt="">
    <p><b><em> ✱ Theodor Herzl himself made several attempts to meet with the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II in order to
                buy land in Palestine for the establishment of a Jewish State. His first attempt was in 1901, where he
                had proposed that if the Sultan allowed the Jews to gain entry into Palestine to form an independent
                entity, then he would pay off all the acquired debts of the Ottoman Empire.

                Sultan Abdul Hamid II rejected the offer, saying that Palestine was not for sale. As he himself said, "I
                wouldn't give an inch of Palestinian land because it's not mine to give away: it belongs to the Islamic
                nation." This meeting became one of the most shining milestones in the history of the conflict between
                the Zionist movement and the Ottoman Empire because Herzl failed to achieve his goal via this way.

                It is important to note that Sultan Abdul Hamid II rebuffed Herzl's efforts, which made him seek other
                international support in order to fulfill the objectives of the Zionist movement, which would later be
                incorporated into the Balfour Declaration in 1917.</em></b></p>

    <h1>what is the conclusion :</h1>
    <p><b><em>✱ Ultimately, Theodor Herzl's attempts to purchase land in Palestine from the Ottoman Empire failed. After
                that, the Zionist movement continued to pursue its goals through other means, including gaining the
                support of the major powers. This effort culminated in the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which supported
                the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and eventually led to the establishment of the
                State of Israel in 1948.</em></b></p>
