    <h1>What Is The Zionist :</h1>
    <img src="images/images.jpeg" alt="">


    <p><b><em> ✱ The most common, mainly used term for the State of Israel by countries or groups, especially in the
                Arab and Islamic world, that refuse to recognize or oppose the policies of Israel as a legitimate state
                is Zionist entity.

                The term derives from Zionism, a late 19th-century Jewish nationalist movement whose purview was to
                establish in Palestine a national homeland for the Jews. It was founded on the ideas by Theodor Herzl
                and other advocates of his stream of thought who actually succeeded in fulfilling such a desideratum: on
                May 8, 1948, Israel was born.

                The use of the term "Zionist entity," instead of "Israel," has a political meaning, which translates to
                a stance against Zionism and its settlement project in Palestine.</em></b></p>

    <h1>who founded it:</h1>
    <p><b><em> ✱ The State of Israel was founded by Theodor Herzl, an Austrian-Hungarian journalist and writer from the
                Jewish community. Herzl can certainly be called the godfather of the Zionist movement because he openly
                insisted that a Jewish state be established in Palestine as a solution to what is referred to as the
                "Jewish question" in Europe. Herzl published his famous book The Jewish State in 1896, in which he put
                forth his idea for establishing an independent Jewish state. He also founded the First Zionist Congress
                in Basel, Switzerland, in 1897. By far, most consider this the actual beginning of the international
                Zionist movement.</em></b></p>

    <h1>who is Theodr Herzl :</h1>
    <p><b><em> ✱ Theodor Herzl was an Austro-Hungarian journalist and writer of Jewish origin, and the founder of the
                modern Zionist movement. In 1896, he published his book The Jewish State, calling for the establishment
                of an independent Jewish state as a solution to the problem of anti-Semitism. He founded the First
                Zionist Congress in 1897, laying the foundations of the movement that would later lead to the
                establishment of the State of Israel.</em></b></p>
